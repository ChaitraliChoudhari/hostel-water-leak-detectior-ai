# AI-Based Hostel Water Leak Detection Assistant
This notebook demonstrates how AI can be used to detect abnormal water usage patterns in hostels in order to identify potential water leaks and reduce water wastage.

## Problem Statement
Hostels experience significant water wastage due to unnoticed leaks and abnormal water usage, especially during night hours. Manual monitoring is inefficient and often detects leaks only after large quantities of water have been wasted.
This notebook presents a simple AI-based approach to analyze water usage data and identify abnormal consumption patterns.

# Import Libraries
import pandas as pd

# Load sample water usage data
data = pd.read_csv("../data/sample_water_usage.csv")

# Display the data
data

## Understanding Normal Water Usage
The system first analyzes historical water usage data to learn normal consumption patterns. 
Higher water usage during daytime is expected, while unusually high usage during night hours may indicate a possible leak.

# Calculate Average Water Usage
average_usage = data['water_usage_liters'].mean()
average_usage

# Detect abnormal water usage (simple anomaly detection)
data['is_abnormal'] = data['water_usage_liters'] > (2 * average_usage)

data

## AI-Based Anomaly Detection
The AI identifies abnormal water usage by comparing current consumption with learned normal patterns.
If water usage exceeds twice the average consumption, the system flags it as a potential leak or abnormal event.

# Generate Alert
abnormal_hours = data[data['is_abnormal']]
if not abnormal_hours.empty:
    print("⚠️ Alert: Possible water leak detected during the following time periods:")
    print(abnormal_hours[['date', 'time', 'water_usage_liters']])
else:
    print("✅ Water usage is normal.")

## Conclusion
This notebook demonstrates a simple AI-driven approach to detect abnormal water usage patterns in hostels. 
By identifying potential leaks early, the system helps reduce water wastage, maintenance costs, and supports sustainable water management aligned with SDG 6.
